## What Makes F3L0N Different?

Unlike traditional process monitors, F3L0N goes beyond simple metric display:

1. **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses AI to understand process behavior patterns and system resource utilization trends

2. **Predictive Capabilities**: Anticipates potential system bottlenecks and resource constraints before they become critical

3. **Smart Categorization**: Automatically groups and categorizes processes based on their behavior and resource usage patterns

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern, intuitive dashboard with real-time updates and interactive visualizations

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket
- **Data Analysis**: Custom AI models for system analysis
- **Process Monitoring**: psutil library with enhanced capabilities
